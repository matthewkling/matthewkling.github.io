I'm broadly interested in the processes that shape the geographic distribuitons of species and biodiversity on a macroecological scale. 

My reserach ranges from The following is a sampling of research projects I currently have in prep.

__Incomplete range filling.__ I'm assessing the utility of climatic niche modeling in testing hypotheses about plant dispersal limitation, including whether prevailing wind patterns are linked to incomplete range filling in North American trees.

__Global weirding.__ Where will anthropogenic climate change deliver a future climate similar to extreme historic years, and where will it deliver "global weirding" -- a breakdown of historic correlations among variables in which future years represent climates with no historic analog? We apply a novel index of multivariate global weirding to late 20th-century trends to map the nature of changes in the covariance structure climate regimes. *Coauthor: [Andrew Crane-Droesch](http://www.cranedroesch.net)*

__Functional biogeography of fire.__ Today's maps of wildfire regimes are based on top-down geophysical parameters and historic fire records. What can we learn from constructing a bottom-up alternative based on fire-related functional traits of the local vegetation communities? *Coauthor: [Jens Stevens](http://www.stevensjt.net)*

__Recent climate exposure of vegetation assemblages.__ Recent trends show that the rate and nature of contemporary climate change is very spatially heterogeneous. We use niche models, interannual typicality, and climate velocity statistics to assess three orthogonal dimensions of cliamate exposure in sagebrush and pinyon-juniper ecosystems.

__Bay Area fire weather.__ Devastating wildfires in the hills near Berkeley are historically associated with Diablo Winds driven by unusual weather conditions. We are exploring the use of machine learning algorithms like self organizing maps to model trends in these synoptic weather patterns. *Coauthors: [David Ackerly](http://www.ackerlylab.org/people/david-ackerly-pi/), [Bill Collins](http://esd.lbl.gov/profiles/william-collins/), and [Max Moritz](https://nature.berkeley.edu/moritzlab/)*

__Climatic niches of the California Flora.__ As part of a larger team project on geographic patterns in the biodiversity of California plants, I am using a new species occurrence dataset to explore macroecological patterns in the geographic and environmental distribution of more than 5000 plant species.
