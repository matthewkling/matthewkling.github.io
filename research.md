I investigate how climate shapes the geographic distributions of genes, species, and ecosystems, and how this understanding can inform biodiversity conservation in the face of climate change. I primarily study plants using big data. My current projects, a sample of which are listed below, involve synthesizing large datasets on species occurrences, plant functional traits, climate, population genetics, phylogenetics, and species endangerment to answer questions related to conservation biogeography. See my [CV](/cv/) for past work and publications.

__Winds of change.__ Gene flow and species range shifts are essential for biodiversity adaptation to climate change. In plants, this happens largely through wind dispersal. How do prevailing wind patterns shape plant movement dynamics at the population genetic and species range levels? And how does wind align with spatial climate change patterns to facilitate or hinder adaptive migration?

__Dimensions of climate vulnerability.__ Predicting vulnerability to climate change is a key challenge for land managers. How does variation in sensitivity to different climate variables, and in the rate and nature of climate change, shape predicted patterns of climate exposure? And how do alternative paradigms of climate novelty affect vulnerability projections and management approaches? In this project we explore these questions at a regional scale with a focus on vegetation the western US. *Coauthors: [Healy Hamilton](http://www.natureserve.org/profile/11844) and Stephanie Auer*

__Conservation biogeography of the California flora.__ The ecology and evolution of plant communities takes place in twisted manifold at the intersection of multidimensional geographic and environmental spaces. As part of the California Plant Phylodiversity Project I'm using a new CCH dataset to explore macroecological patterns in the geographic ranges and climatic niches of 5000+ California plant species. *Coauthors: [CPPP](http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/bryolab/CPPP/)*

__Global weirding.__ Where will anthropogenic climate change deliver a future climate similar to extreme historic years, and where will it deliver "global weirding" -- a breakdown of historic correlations among variables, in which future years represent climates with no historic analog? We apply a novel index of multivariate global weirding to late 20th-century trends to map the nature of changes in the covariance structure of climate regimes. *Coauthor: [Andrew Crane-Droesch](http://www.cranedroesch.net)*

__Functional biogeography of fire.__ Today's maps of wildfire regimes are based on top-down geophysical parameters and historic fire records. What can we learn from constructing a bottom-up alternative based on fire-related functional traits of the local vegetation communities? *Coauthor: [Jens Stevens](http://www.stevensjt.net)*

__Bay Area fire weather.__ Devastating wildfires in the hills near Berkeley are historically associated with Diablo Winds driven by unusual weather conditions. We are exploring the use of machine learning algorithms like self organizing maps to model trends in these synoptic weather patterns. *Coauthors: [David Ackerly](http://www.ackerlylab.org/people/david-ackerly-pi/), [Bill Collins](http://esd.lbl.gov/profiles/william-collins/), and [Max Moritz](https://nature.berkeley.edu/moritzlab/)*
