# Visualizing change

This animation depicts a century of projected climate change. It turned out scarier than I expected. 

Each color represents the climate fingerprint of a distinctive combination of 27 biologically-relevant climate variables. We can see different types of change occurring in different regions. Overland velocities are highest across the Midwest and Great Plains. The Gulf coast and the central Rockies have contracting climates that are projected to disappear by mid-century. In places like the northern Rockies and the Southeast, we see the emergence of novel climates representing combinations of climate variables with no historical analog. 

In the face of climate change, biota will need to adapt in situ to new conditions, migrate to remain within their baseline climate, or face local extripation. 

# Data

These climate data are the mean predictions of an ensemble of CMIP5 global circulation models run under the RCP 8.5 emissions scenario. Data are 30-year normals from the ClimateNA dataset for the 1961-1990 era and the 2080s era. I linearlly interpolated climate signatures between these two periods to produce a smooth animation.

# Dimension reduction

A big challenge in data vizualization is representing high-dimensional data in 2D. The approach I took here was to reduce the climate dimensions to a single color for each pixel, while leaving space and time in their native forms. I first used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to embed the 27 climate variables into 3 dimensions, which I then mapped to RGB colorspace such that color similarity represents climatic similarity. Of course, this mapping could take many forms; I rank-transformed the RGB values to increase contrast, produced a menu of possible palettes, and picked one with a nice gestalt.

# Parameters

There were a lot of subjective decisions in this process whose effects would be interesting to explore. The choice of climate variables, dimension reduction algorithm, RGB rescaling method, and number of clusters all influence the look and feel of the results.
