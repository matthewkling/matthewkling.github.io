A couple years ago I was building an ecological niche model for a project on fog-loving coast redwood trees, and became frustrated by the nonexistence of gridded spatial data on fogginess. So I decided to take a stab at creating my own. Here's the [poster](/assets/agu_fog_poster.pdf) on that analysis that I put together for this week's [American Geophysical Union](http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2016/) fall meeting---looking forward to getting feedback from some bona fide climatologists.
