A couple years ago I was building an ecological niche model for a project on fog-loving coast redwood trees, and became frustrated by the nonexistence of gridded spatial data on fog frequency. Thus began a little side project to create such a dataset. Here's the [poster](/assets/agu_fog_poster.pdf) on that analysis that I put together for this week's [American Geophysical Union](http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2016/) fall meeting---should be interesting to get some feedback from the real climatologists.
