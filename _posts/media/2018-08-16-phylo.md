The [California Plant Phylodiversity Atlas](https://matthewkling.shinyapps.io/phylodiversity/) (CAPPA) is an interactive web application I built to accompany our forthcoming paper focused on conserving the evolutionary diversity of California plants, which is part of a broader research project called the [California Plant Phylodiversity Project](http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/bryolab/CPPP/). It was a fun Shiny app to put together, including use of the plotly, leaflet, and DT libraries, as well as integration with images from the [Jepson eFlora](http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/eflora/). The underlying data is species distribution models we built for all 5221 species of native plants in the state, plus their evolutionary relationships as defined based on historical mutation, speciation, and survival time. In this study we identify key locations within the state that contain concentrations of taxa that are evolutionarily distinct and poorly conserved across their ranges. These vulnerable biodiversity hotspots are potential priorities for future conservtion management efforts.
