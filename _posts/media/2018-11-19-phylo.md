We have a [new paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2017.0397) out today in *PhilTransB* that looks at the geographic ranges and evolutionary relationships of 5221 California plant species to identify priority locations for increased land protection. To accompany the paper I built the [California Plant Phylodiversity Atlas](http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/phylodiversity/), a web application that lets users interact with the phylogeny, geography, and local community dimensions of our biodiversity dataset. It was a fun Shiny app to put together, including use of the plotly, leaflet, and DT libraries, as well as integration with images from the [Jepson eFlora](http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/eflora/). Check it out and let me know what you think!
