title: ESCAPING FLATLAND WITH 2D & 3D COLOR RAMPS 
---

Edward Tufte, the godfather of modern information visualization, identifies embedding multidimensional datasets onto a 2D page or screen as a core challenge of data communication. He calls this "escaping flatland". 

A typical graphic can convey relationships among just a few variables, using the x and y dimensions of the page plus small multiples (which add additional x and y dimensions) and movement, shape, and color (which add z dimensions). Lately I've been playing a lot with color as I work to explore and communicate relationships among multiple variables. 

We're all familiar with the one-dimensional color ramps supported by most plottig software. But the beautiful thing about color is that it's three-dimensional, which means we can use it to simultaneously express the values of two or three variables for a single data point.
