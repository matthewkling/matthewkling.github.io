Thanks for stopping by. 

I work at the intersection of computational ecology, global change biology, and conservation biogeography. My research is focused largely on plants, and spans a range of biotic scales ranging from genes to species to ecosystems. Beyond basic research in ecology, I'm a fan of translational research, open source science, and data visualization.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Gund Institute for the the Environment, and the Department of Biology, at the University of Vermont. I'm working with an interdisciplinary team to develop and apply modeling tools aimed at understanding how forested and agricultural landscapes will adapt to climate change.
